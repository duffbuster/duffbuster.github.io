## Want to make your own resume from JSON?

* `sudo npm install -g resume-cli`
* `mkdir resume; cd resume`
* `resume init`
* This will give you a template resume.json file. Edit, then to create a html from it using the template I used:
* `resume export index.html -t slick`

more options including publishing to their registry at http://jsonresume.org
